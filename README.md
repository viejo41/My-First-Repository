# My-First-Repository
A sandbox test platform on which to place trial projects -- nothing serious I hope!

I don't know much about markdown, but I have written a lot of technical descriptions of my work in MS Word and Excel.  I usually convert these to PDFs.  If I can learn to use simple markdown commands the visual appeal of these monographs might improve.

As a test platform, I can append to this as I add projects.

Sooo, here is my *first* edit; done right on GitHub rather than my own machine.  Later, I'll learn to pull and push changes made on my own machine back and forth to GitHub.

Here is a list of items I've made on my own PC using VSCode:

1.  Item 1
1.  Item 2
1.  Item 3
    1.  Item 3.a
    1.  Item 3.b
    1.  Item 3.c

**Don't under any circumstances...**  ... uhhh, what was I going to say?
